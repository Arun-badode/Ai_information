                Darktrace AI is a cybersecurity platform that uses artificial
                intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to offer proactive
                protection and detection of cyber threats. Unlike traditional
                security systems, Darktrace uses self-learning algorithms to
                monitor network traffic, user activity, and endpoint behavior in
                real time. This allows it to detect even the most advanced cyber
                threats, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs), ransomware,
                and insider threats, before they can cause significant damage.
                The platform offers autonomous response capabilities that can
                neutralize threats without human intervention, improving
                response times and minimizing the risk of attacks.
              </p>
